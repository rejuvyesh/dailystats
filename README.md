Daily Arbtt Statistics
======================

Daily usage statistics straight from my laptop. Stolen a few things from [@karpathy's](https://github.com/karpathy/) [ulogme](https://github.com/karpathy/ulogme). Only I am not that comfortable sharing my entire usage history like him. Might be possible to do so for a work computer, certainly not for a personal laptop.

I like [arbtt](http://arbtt.nomeata.de/#what). The logs are a little safer and it's easy to find usage stats using `arbtt-stats`. But an ascii table is not as visually striking as a colored donut chart.

There a few issues remaining that need to be resolved, otherwise this works fine. I guess the code can be simplified and any pull requests are welcome.

TODO
----

- Handle categories maybe?
- Find why some are greater than 100. (For now we've hacked around it.)
